# Design

This document provides information about the design of the Minecraft Pig. First, Section 1 provides information about the Minecraft Pig's colour scheme. Thereafter, Section 2 provides information about the grid system used to design the Minecraft Pig.

The colour scheme and grid design images were created using Affinity Designer. The `.afdesign` files are available in the [affinity_designer](../assets/affinity_designer) folder.

## 1. Colour Scheme

The colour scheme used for the design of the Minecraft Pig is presented by Figure 1. The light pink colour is used for the body while the dark pink colour is used for the toes and the nostrils. The sclerae of the eyes are white and the pupils are black. The internal surfaces of the Minecraft Pig are white.

Table 1: The hex codes for the Minecraft Pig's colour scheme

| Enclosure Colours |  Hex code |
|-------------------|:---------:|
| Light Pink        | `#F5B9D2` |
| Dark Pink         | `#D53B77` |

## 2. Grid Design

A grid system is used for the design of the Minecraft Pig.

In the grid system, the legs have dimensions of 4 blocks x 4 blocks x 6 blocks. 

The design uses 67 mm x 67 mm pine posts for the legs.

This results in 16 mm x 16 mm grid, as shown below:

$Grid\ size = \frac{Leg\ width}{4} = \frac{67\ mm}{4} = 16.75\ mm \approx 16\ mm$
